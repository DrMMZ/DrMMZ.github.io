## Projects

* [Digit Recognizer](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/DrMMZ/drmmz.github.io/blob/master/dr.nb.html)

We use multi-class classification algorithms such as one-vs-all logistic regression and regularized single hidden layer neural networks to predict [handwritten digits](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer).

* [Credit Card Fraud Detection](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/DrMMZ/drmmz.github.io/blob/master/FraudDetection.nb.html)

We detect anomalous behavior in credit card transactions using the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). The problem can be solved by supervised learning and anomaly detection. In particular, we will use logistic regression with regularization and Gaussian models.

* [Spam Emails Classification](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/DrMMZ/drmmz.github.io/blob/master/Spam.nb.html)

Given an email, we train a classifier to classify whether the email is spam or non-spam. In particular, we create a vocabulary list using some techniques in text processing and convert each email into a feature vector. Then we use logistic regression, neural networks and SVM to build spam filters. The dataset is based on a subset of the [SpamAssassin Public Corpus](http://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus). At the end, we inspect the top predictive words for spam classified by logistic regression and SVM, respectively. Interestingly, they are quite different.

* [Is grade of failure related to class schedule?](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/DrMMZ/drmmz.github.io/blob/master/School.html)

We would like to discern whether there are real differences between the grade of failure rate of postsecondary students according to their class schedule. We will use a dataset extracted from a [database](https://www.kaggle.com/Madgrades/uw-madison-courses) and apply SQL technique.

* [Some analyses on PhD graduates in Canada](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/DrMMZ/drmmz.github.io/blob/master/Grad.html)

We are interested in some statistics on PhD graduates in Canada, specially in population of PhD graduates and who pursued further education after PhD graduation. The data is extracted from [National graduates survey, postsecondary graduates by province of study and level of study, Table 37-10-0030-01, Statistics Canada](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3710003001). The results are interpreted as geographic patterns in the map of Canada.
